# Tiny Habit Tracker 📝

Just a minimalist habit tracker you can use as a default/start page in your browser. It uses local storage. I made this because 'advanced' habit tracker apps have too many bells and whistles. Habit trackers should be as approachable as possible.

## Features ✨

- Minimalist design
- Uses local storage
- Easy to use
- Contains some cool easter eggs 🥚
